"""
This Python script is a component of the Destination X service.

The script is designed to be run as a Flask web application, 
allowing for easy integration with other components of the 
Destination X service.

It fetches the chepeast flight price from the users location to their possible destinations with the following parameters:

    - Origin city/location
    - Destinaion city/location
    - Departure date
    - Return date
    - Number of passengers
    - Maximum price
    - Desired currency

It uses the Amadeus API to get flight prices and availability 
based on these criteria and displays them.

The chepeast flight offer is  with added filtering
for the following parameters:

    - City to IATA code conversion
    - Sorting my lowest price
    - Filtering by number of stops, with preference to direct flights
      where available. If not, 1 stop is allowed or the option with the least stops with the chepeast price.
